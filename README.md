# L-System-Tree-Simulation
Tree growth simulation throughout the seasons in Python framework L-Py, created for **Python for Engineering** classes at Adam Mickiewicz's University.
#
## Simulation
Simulation code is contained in `tree_final.lpy` file. It should be executed in **L-Py Studio**.
#
## Statistics
File `stats.py` includes statistics module. Notice that the module's code is written in **Python 3**, contrary to simulation module, which was written in **Python 2** because of L-Py constraints.

**IMPORTANT!!**

Before executing the statistics script, make sure that the whole simulation is finished (or just simply press `Execute` inside L-Py studio), as it depends heavily on data, which is collected throughout the simulation and is written to the file at the end.
